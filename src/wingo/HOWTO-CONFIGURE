Configuring Wingo
=================
Running

    wingo --write-config

will (in all likelihood) write a fresh copy of the configuration files to your 
$HOME/.config/wingo directory. The configuration files are full of comments.

If you've made changes to your configuration, you have to restart Wingo in 
order for the changes to take effect. You can restart Wingo by running the 
Restart command. (See HOWTO-COMMANDS for a primer on Wingo commands.)
